    def __init__(self):

# init is short for initialization. It is a constructor which gets called
# when you make an instance of the class and it is not necessary.
# But usually it our practice to write init method
# for setting default state of the object.

# __init__ is one of the reserved methods in Python.
# In object oriented programming, it is known as a constructor.
# The __init__ method can be called when an object is created from the class,
# and access is required to initialize the attributes of the class.

# The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.
# Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state.
# The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class
# when an object of class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains
# collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation.
# It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
# The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
