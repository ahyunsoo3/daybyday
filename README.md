# Introduction 
To broaden my basic coding, logic, and structure of building a software skills.

We normally aim to solve as many issues as we can. However, it not only helps us process that we didn't understand. You can achieve many things from that because it helps you experience so many things. Yet, it is not appropriate for you understand your phase. If you really hope to develop your steps at your level, you have to break down the problems that you encounter.

But, if you try to get good grades at school, this perspective might not gives you the best grades. Thus, you won't adopt this belief without any consideration.


# Time 
I normally don't pay attention to the time until I finally solve something because it is not helpful for me to understand the knowledge of codes. Still, If you wish to cut down your time spent, you should measure your time for each of your solved problems. As the time passes, you could be ahead of previous days.

Achievements follow the difficulty that is made in complexity. (Not absolute because basis can inspire us more easily)
